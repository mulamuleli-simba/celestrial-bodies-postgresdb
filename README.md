# celestrial-bodies-postgresdb

This excercise was done to complete the FreeCodeCamp course on databases.

It required creating a universe database and then creating tables which where, galaxy, star, planet and moon. I later then added a satellite table to the database as part of the excercise.

To populate the tables, I created columns of attributes that can easily be accessed on the internet and later populated them with the help of research as well as natural language chatbot.

Throughout the excercise there were challanges pertaining to SQL language that I have overcome with a little help from varous community websites as well as YouTube. 

Overall, I enjoyed the excercise and the opportunity to learn.
